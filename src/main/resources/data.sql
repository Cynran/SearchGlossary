First, all of Dan’s creatures are tagged for destruction. Then Archimedes’ neighbors "Destroyed:" effects resolve, archiving them. The battleline immediately collapses, but Archimedes’ new neighbors have already been tagged for destruction and cannot gain a new "Destroyed:" ability, so they are placed in the discard pile along with Archimedes. </p><p>Example: Emily has a Jehu the Bureaucrat, Duma the Martyr with 2 damage, and Commander Remiel with 1 damage in play. Her opponent plays a Poison Wave, dealing 2 damage to each creature. This damage causes Duma the Martyr and Commander Remiel to be tagged for destruction. Duma the Martyr’s "Destroyed:" effect resolves, healing Jehu the Bureaucrat and Commander Remiel. Since Commander Remiel was already tagged for destruction, it still goes to the discard pile with Duma the Martyr, but Jehu the Bureaucrat survives unscathed. </p><p>Example: Marcus has a Groggins with a Phoenix Heart in play. His opponent, Janelle, has a Dust Imp with a Soulkeeper, a Drumble, and a Shaffles in play. Marcus fights Dust Imp with Groggins, causing Dust Imp to be tagged for destruction. Dust Imp’s "Destroyed:" ability and the "Destroyed:" ability that Soulkeeper grants it both trigger simultaneously. Marcus chooses to let his opponent gain the 2 Æmber first, then resolve the Soulkeeper, which will destroy Marcus’s most powerful creature— Groggins. When Groggins is tagged for destruction, the Phoenix Heart attached to it resolves, returning Groggins to Marcus’s hand and dealing 3 damage to each other creature.
